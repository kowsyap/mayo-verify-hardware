Hardware Implementation of Signature Verification in the New Post-Quantum Signature Scheme MAYO

## Abstract:
The  MAYO  signature  scheme  is  a  promising  PQC method based on multivariate quadratic equations, offering smaller public keys compared to the Oil-and-Vinegar (OV) scheme.  This  paper  focuses  on  the  hardware  implementation  of the MAYO Verify algorithm, addressing challenges in polynomial arithmetic  and  GF  arithmetic  operations.  The  implementation results  demonstrate  efficient  verification  with  reduced latency and enhanced scalability for various parameter sets.
